1. Create the user systemd directory if it doesn't exist:
   ${GREEN}mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/${NC}

2. Move the generated file to the user systemd directory:
   ${GREEN}mv ./"${SERVICE_NAME}" ~/.config/systemd/user/"${SERVICE_NAME}"${NC}

3. Reload the systemd user daemon:
   ${GREEN}systemctl --user daemon-reload${NC}

4. Enable the service to start when you log in:
   ${GREEN}systemctl --user enable ${SERVICE_NAME}${NC}

5. Start the service now:
   ${GREEN}systemctl --user start ${SERVICE_NAME}${NC}

6. Check its status:
   ${GREEN}systemctl --user status ${SERVICE_NAME}${NC}
